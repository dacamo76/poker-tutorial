      Tutorial: HTTP API Call 1

      There is no single prescribed mechanism to integrate API calls with a Redux application. We'll explore
      two common methods.

      The first is to make an API call before calling into the Redux action. Here we call one of our own
      functions, it does the API call, and then dispatches an action.

      Scroll down to the startNewGame() method and follow instructions.

        Tutorial: Player names


        Here we have a shortcut method that adds six players with hard-coded names and then
        starts the game.

        Let's change this method to instead call out to the same sample data endpoint
        we used in tutorial 1 to get a list of users, and use those to create players.

            https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

        Use these concepts from the first tutorial
